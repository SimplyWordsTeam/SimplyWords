# SimplyWords

Welcome to the repository for SimplyWords! SimplyWords is an Android app made to make it easier for senior Singaporeans who have difficulty comprehending content on digital services. It is an app made to simplify and rewrite text to increase readability and understandability. This project is created as part of the Portfolio Development module at Ngee Ann Polytechnic.

## Motivation

As part of the module, we were given a sponsor that presented us with a problem statement. The statement was:

> Closing the digital divide for common services

Based on this, we decided to focus on the elderly in Singapore. We found that many elderly Singaporeans have difficulty understanding content, mainly because many of them aren't well-versed in English, and many digital services are not available in other languages. We decided to create an app that would help to simplify and rewrite text to increase readability and understandability.

## Getting started

0. We use the OpenAI API to simplify and rewrite text. You will need to create an account and get an API key from the [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/). If paid less than $5, there is significant chance that rate limits will be hit.

1. Clone the repository to a desired location on your computer:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/SimplyWordsTeam/SimplyWords
   ```

2. Launch the project in Android Studio.

3. Run the project on an emulator or physical device by clicking the "Run" button and the top right corner of the screen.
